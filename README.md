# UserAPI App

I created a small React app using data from an API. I also used hooks and functional programming.

You can select a gender (default is any). When you click the button, it loads a random user's photo along with his/her title, name, age, country, email and phone number. 
The background colour changes based on the gender.
- Swipe left for more choices and right when your happy with a selection.
It is also mobile responsive.

Goal: to store a favourited selection and option to email the person. 
Possibly add a map feature to show where they are located.
